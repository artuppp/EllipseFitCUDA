# EllipseFitCUDA
Ellipse Fit Implementation in CUDA

This repository contains an CUDA GPU-accelerated implementation of a fitting ellipse based on least-squares approach. This is completely based on 
Ohad Gal (2023). fit_ellipse (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/3215-fit_ellipse), MATLAB Central File Exchange.

It uses CUBLAS and CUSOLVE libraries which are included into the NVIDIA CUDA TOOLKIT
